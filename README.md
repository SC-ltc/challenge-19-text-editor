# Module 19 Challenge - Text Editor

## Description

The objective of this assignment was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The application is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
